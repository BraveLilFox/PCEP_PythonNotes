# Intro to Python & Computer Programming

### *How Does A Computer Program Work?*
- *Programs* make a computer usuable; without a *program*, a computer is nothing more than an object.
- Computers can only perform *EXTREMELY SIMPLE* operations
  - EX: a computer cannot understand the value of complicated mathematical function by itself.
- **Comtemporary Computers** can only really evaluate the results of very fundamental operations like adding, or dividing. But they can do this with extreme speed and accuracy.
- These **FOUR** simple actions represent a *Program*: (just an example)
  - Accept a number representing the distance;
  - Accept a number representing the travel time;
  - Divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;
  - Display the result(representing the average speed) in a readable format.
- **LANGUAGE** is the keyword.

### *Natural Language VS Programming Languages.*
- A ***LANGUAGE*** is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts;
- Computers have their own languages too, this is called ***MACHINE LANGUAGE*** which is *extremely* rudimentary;
- You could say a computer is like a well-trained dog - *it only responds to a predetermined set of **KNOWN** commands*;
- A complete set of known commands is called an *INSTRUCTION LIST*, typically abbreviated as *'IL'*;
  - *NOTE: MACHINE LANGUAGES ARE DEVELOPED BY **HUMANS***
- No computer is *CURRENTLY* capable of creating a new language (this might change soon);
- Human languages are developed **NATURALLY** and are still evolving with new words appearing everyday and old words disappearing, these are the ***NATURAL LANGUAGES***.

### *What Makes A Language?*
Machine or Natural, each language consists of the following:
1. An **ALPHABET**: a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language(e.g., the Latin alphabet for English, the Cyrillic for Russian, Kanji for Japanese and so on...);
2. A **LEXIS**: (aka dictionary) a set of words the language offers its users (e.g., the word "computer" comes from the English Dictionary, while "cmopture" doesn't; the word "chat" is present in both the English and French Dictionaries, but their meanings are exponentially different);
3. A **SYNTAX**: a set of rules (formal/informal, written/felt intuitively) used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence (e.g., "I am a python" is a syntactically correct phrase, while "I a python am." isn't correct);
4. **SEMANTICS**: a set of rules determining if a certain phrase  makes sense (e.g., "I ate a doughnut" makes sense, but "A doughnut ate me." doesn't necessarily make the most sense);

The **IL** is, in fact ***the alphabet of a machine language***. The computer tongue. Unfortunately we need a bridge between that of the human tongue and computer tongue, a common language.
  - Such languages are often called *high-level programming languages*;
  - Somewhat similar to natural ones at least because they used symbols, words, and conventions readable to the human knowledge.

A program written in a *high-level programming language* is called **SOURCE CODE**(in contrast to the machine code executed by computers); Similarly, the file containing the **SOURCE CODE** is called the **SOURCE FILE**.

### *Compilation VS Interpretation.*
Computer programming is the act of composing the selected programming language's elements in the order that will cause the desired effect.

Of course, such a composition has to be correct in many senses:
1. **Alphabetically** - a program needs to be written in a recognizable script such as Roman, Cyrillic, etc;
2. **Lexically** - each programming language has its dictionary and you need to master it; thankfully it's much more simple than any natural language;
3. **Syntactically** - each language has its rules and they *must* be obeyed;
4. **Semantically** - the program has to make sense;

Unfortunately, it is easy for a programmer to make a mistake with each of the above four senses. This causes the program to essentially become *useless*.

These are the ***TWO*** different ways of **transforming a program from a high-level programming language into a machine language**.
1. ***COMPILATION*** - the source program is translated once(however, this act must be repeated EACH time you modify the source code) by getting a file(e.g., an .exe file if the code is intended to be run under MS Windows) containing the machine code; now you can distribute the file worldwide; the program that performs this translation is called a **COMPILER** or **TRANSLATOR**;
2. ***INTERPRETATION*** - you(or any user of the code) can translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an **INTERPRETER**, as it interprets the code every single time as it is intended to be executed; it also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as-is, because the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it.

### *What Does The Interpreter Actually Do?*
Now, your program actually exists as a **computer file**: a computer program is actually a piece of text, so the source code is usually placed in **text files**.

*NOTE*: it has to be **PURE TEXT**, without any decoration like different fonts, colors, embedded images, etc..

The *interpreter* reads the source code in the same way as Western Culture:
- From top to bottom;
- And left to right;
- (with a few exceptions);

1. **FIRST** the *interpreter* checks if all subsequent lines are correct;
  1. if the *interpreter* finds an error, its work finishes IMMEDIATELY.

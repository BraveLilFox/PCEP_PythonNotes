# Intro to Python & Computer Programming

### *How does a computer program work?*
- *Programs* make a computer usuable; without a *program*, a computer is nothing more than an object.
- Computers can only perform *EXTREMELY SIMPLE* operations
  - EX: a computer cannot understand the value of complicated mathematical function by itself.
- **Comtemporary Computers** can only really evaluate the results of very fundamental operations like adding, or dividing. But they can do this with extreme speed and accuracy.
- These **FOUR** simple actions represent a *Program*: (just an example)
  - Accept a number representing the distance;
  - Accept a number representing the travel time;
  - Divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;
  - Display the result(representing the average speed) in a readable format.
- **LANGUAGE** is the keyword.

### *Natural Language VS Programming Languages.*
- A ***LANGUAGE*** is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts;
- Computers have their own languages too, this is called ***MACHINE LANGUAGE*** which is *extremely* rudimentary;
- You could say a computer is like a well-trained dog - *it only responds to a predetermined set of **KNOWN** commands*;
- A complete set of known commands is called an *INSTRUCTION LIST*, typically abbreviated as *'IL'*;
  - *NOTE: MACHINE LANGUAGES ARE DEVELOPED BY **HUMANS***
- No computer is *CURRENTLY* capable of creating a new language (this might change soon);
- Human languages are developed **NATURALLY** and are still evolving with new words appearing everyday and old words disappearing, these are the ***NATURAL LANGUAGES***.

### *What Makes A Language?*

### *Compilation VS Interpretation.*

### *What Does The Interpreter Actually Do?*

### *Compilation VS Interpretation - Advantages And Disadvantages*

### *What is Python?*

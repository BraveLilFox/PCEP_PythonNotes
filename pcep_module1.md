# Intro to Python & Computer Programming

### *How does a computer program work?*
- *Programs* make a computer usuable; without a *program*, a computer is nothing more than an object.
- Computers can only perform *EXTREMELY SIMPLE* operations
  - EX: a computer cannot understand the value of complicated mathematical function by itself.
- **Comtemporary Computers** can only really evaluate the results of very fundamental operations like adding, or dividing. But they can do this with extreme speed and accuracy.
- These **FOUR** simple actions represent a *Program*: (just an example)
  - Accept a number representing the distance;
  - Accept a number representing the travel time;
  - Divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;
  - Display the result(representing the average speed) in a readable format.
- **LANGUAGE** is the keyword.

### *Natural Language VS Programming Languages.*
- A ***LANGUAGE*** is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts;
- Computers have their own languages too, this is called ***MACHINE LANGUAGE*** which is *extremely* rudimentary;
- You could say a computer is like a well-trained dog - *it only responds to a predetermined set of **KNOWN** commands*;
- A complete set of known commands is called an *INSTRUCTION LIST*, typically abbreviated as *'IL'*;
  - *NOTE: MACHINE LANGUAGES ARE DEVELOPED BY **HUMANS***
- No computer is *CURRENTLY* capable of creating a new language (this might change soon);
- Human languages are developed **NATURALLY** and are still evolving with new words appearing everyday and old words disappearing, these are the ***NATURAL LANGUAGES***.

### *What Makes A Language?*
Machine or Natural, each language consists of the following:
1. An **ALPHABET**: a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language(e.g., the Latin alphabet for English, the Cyrillic for Russian, Kanji for Japanese and so on...);
2. A **LEXIS**: (aka dictionary) a set of words the language offers its users (e.g., the word "computer" comes from the English Dictionary, while "cmopture" doesn't; the word "chat" is present in both the English and French Dictionaries, but their meanings are exponentially different);
3. A **SYNTAX**: a set of rules (formal/informal, written/felt intuitively) used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence (e.g., "I am a python" is a syntactically correct phrase, while "I a python am." isn't correct);
4. **SEMANTICS**: a set of rules determining if a certain phrase  makes sense (e.g., "I ate a doughnut" makes sense, but "A doughnut ate me." doesn't necessarily make the most sense);

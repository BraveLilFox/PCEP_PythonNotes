# Intro to Python & Computer Programming

### *How does a computer program work?*
- *Programs* make a computer usuable; without a *program*, a computer is nothing more than an object.
- Computers can only perform *EXTREMELY SIMPLE* operations
  - EX: a computer cannot understand the value of complicated mathematical function by itself.
- **Comtemporary Computers** can only really evaluate the results of very fundamental operations like adding, or dividing. But they can do this with extreme speed and accuracy.
- These **FOUR** simple actions represent a *Program*: (just an example)
  - Accept a number representing the distance;
  - Accept a number representing the travel time;
  - Divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;
  - Display the result(representing the average speed) in a readable format.

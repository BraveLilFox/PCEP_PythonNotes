# Learning Targets

### [Module 1: *Intro to Python & Computer Programming*](pcep_module1.md)
In this module, you will learn about:
1. The fundamentals of computer programming, i.e., how the computer works, how the program is executed, how the programming language is defined and constructed;
2. The difference between compilation and interpretation;
3. What *Python* is, how it is positioned among other programming languages, and what distinguishes the different *Python* versions.

### [Module 2: *Data Types, Variables, Basic I/O Operations & Basic Operators*](pcep_module2.md)
In this module, you will learn about:
1. How to write and run simple *Python Programs*;
2. What *Python* literals, operators, and expressions are;
3. What variables are and what are the rules that govern them;
4. How to perform basic I/O operations.

### [Module 3: *Boolean Values, Conditional Execution, Loops, Lists and List Processing Logical & Bitwise Operations](pcep_module3.md)
In this module, you will learn about:
1. The *Boolean* data types;
2. Relational Operators;
3. Making decissions in *Python* (if, if-else, if-elif, else);
4. How to repeat code execution using loops (while, for);
5. How to perform logic and bitwise operations in *Python*;
6. Lists in *Python* (constructing, indexing, and slicing; content manipulation);
7. How to sort a list using bubble-sort algorithms;
8. Multidimansional lists and their applications.

### [Module 4: *Functions, Tuples, Dictionaries, Data Processing, and Execeptions*](pcep_module4.md)
